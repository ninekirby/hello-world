# hello-world
This is a description. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Here's hoping I learn things.

I'm a college student at NVCC in Virginia, with hopes of transferring to George Mason University where I intend to pursue a bachellors in Computer Engineering. I love videogames, programming, and making people smile. Also books. Reading is fun. (-☞ ᐛ )-☞
